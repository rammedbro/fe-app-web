        <p class="mt-2">
          We collect and store the data that you provide on this website. But don’t worry! This data is used
          <strong>only</strong> for feature demonstration purposes. That means:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
          <li>Your input helps showcase how our platform would work in a real-world scenario.</li>
          <li>The data lives only in our database and goes absolutely nowhere else.</li>
          <li>No actual car rentals happen here. Sorry!</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">2. What We Do With Your Data (Hint: Nothing Sketchy)</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          The information you provide is stored so you can experience the full functionality of this demo website.
          However:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
          <li>We don’t sell, rent, or share your information with anyone.</li>
          <li>We don’t process payments (because, again, this is not a real service).</li>
          <li>Your data stays on this website and is not used for anything beyond making this project look awesome.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">3. Cookies (Yes, But Not the Edible Kind)</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Like most websites, we may use cookies to enhance your experience. These cookies don’t track you across the
          web, they just help make sure things run smoothly while you’re here.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">4. Your Rights (Not That You Need Them Here)</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Since this website doesn’t actually provide a real service, your data is more like a test entry than personal
          information. But, if you really want to, you can request to have your test data removed at any time.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">5. Security (We Care, But There’s No Real Risk)</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          We follow standard security practices to keep your demo data safe. However, since this is a demonstration
          project, we strongly advise against using real personal details. Be creative! Use fake names like "John Doe"
          or "Speedy McCarRenter."
        </p>

      <section class="mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">6. Changes to This Policy (If We Ever Feel Like It)</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          We might update this privacy policy if we add new demo features. If you’re really that invested, feel free to
          check back every now and then.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">7. Contact Us (But, You Know, It’s Just a Demo)</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          If you have any questions, concerns, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out. But remember, there are
          no actual rental cars here, no customer support, and no refunds (because, well, you never paid anything in the
          first place).
