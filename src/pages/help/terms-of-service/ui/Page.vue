        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">1. Acceptance of These Totally Fake Terms</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          By using this website, you acknowledge that you are participating in a <strong>demonstration project</strong>.
          Nothing here is real. We don’t rent out actual cars, and you won’t get a refund (because you never paid
          anything).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">2. User Responsibilities (Not That There Are Many)</h2>
        <ul class="mt-2 list-disc pl-6">
          <li>Have fun exploring this demo.</li>
          <li>Don’t use real personal data—we suggest cool names like "Max Speedster."</li>
          <li>Understand that no actual transactions will take place.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">3. Account Creation (If You Even Want To)</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          You may be able to create an account, but don’t expect a fleet of rental cars to arrive at your doorstep. Your
          account exists solely for testing and demonstration purposes.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">4. Payments (Spoiler: There Are None)</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          We do not accept payments because this service is fictional. If you somehow manage to send us money, we will
          be very confused.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">5. Liability (There Is None)</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Since this website is not real, we are not responsible for anything that happens while using it. Did you think
          you actually rented a car? That’s on you, buddy.
        </p>

      <section class="mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">6. Termination of Access (If We Feel Like It)</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          We reserve the right to remove access to this site for absolutely no reason at all. But let’s be real, you’ll
          probably get bored and leave first.
        </p>

      <section class="mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">7. Changes to These Terms (If We Ever Bother)</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">We might update these terms at some point. Will you check back? Probably not.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">8. Contact Information (But Not Really)</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Got questions? Concerns? Want to complain? That’s cute. Leave us feedback through some form that you may one
          day find on this website, probably somewhere in the right corner.
